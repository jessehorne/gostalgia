![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

The goal of this project is to create a fun Go development environment that feels nostalgic for those that have used BASIC, Applesoft BASIC in particular and other old systems. This is a creative exercise, not an attempt to clone any one system.

**Fun over Functionality.**
